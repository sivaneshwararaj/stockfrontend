                CalOPPA is the nation's first state law requiring commercial
                websites and online services to disclose a privacy policy. The

                or company in the United States (and possibly the world) that
                operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
                from California consumers to post a prominent privacy policy on
                its website stating exactly what information is being collected
                and with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this
