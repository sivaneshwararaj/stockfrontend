                data. Insofar as personal data (for example name, address or e-mail
                addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done, as far
                as possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on
                to third parties without your express consent. We point out that
                data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail)
                security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third
                parties is not possible. The use of contact data published within

                is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly
                reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited

                CalOPPA is the nation's first state law requiring commercial
                websites and online services to disclose a privacy policy. The
                law's scope extends far beyond California, requiring any person
                or company in the United States (and possibly the world) that
                operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
                from California consumers to post a prominent privacy policy on
                its website stating exactly what information is being collected
                and with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this
