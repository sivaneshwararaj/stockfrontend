              A call option is one of the two fundamental types of options. The
              holder of a call option has the option, but not the obligation, to
              purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price in
              the future.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is useful to understand some basic terminology regarding the strike
              of a call option:

              OTM options expire worthless, whereas ITM options hold value at
              expiration. However, simply being ITM doesn't guarantee profit.
              You need to consider the price you paid for the option. For
              instance, if you paid $5 per contract and the option is in the
              money by $2, you'd incur a $3 loss.
              <br />
              <br />
              Profiting from the option at expiration requires it to be ITM by more
              than the amount you paid for it; simple as that.

            <div class="text-white text-lg pl-3 pr-3">
              To break even at expiration, the underlying stock price must be
              higher than the strike price plus the premium you paid for the
              option.
              <br />
              <br />
              For example, if you paid $5.00 for a 100 call and the stock is now
              worth $103, you will still lose money ($2 x 100 = $200) because you
              must cover the cost of the option.
              <br />
              <br />
              Because of this, you really want the stock to go well above your strike
              price (depending on how much you paid for the option). Otherwise you
              will constantly be worrying if the stock is going to make it, which
              often leads to panic selling.
              <br />
              <br />
              As a result, you want the stock to rise significantly above your strike
              price (depending on the amount you paid for the option). Otherwise,
              you'll be constantly worried about whether the stock will make it,
              which can lead to panic selling.

              A call option will lose value as time passes due to theta decay.
              The rate of this accelerates as expiration approaches, with the
              majority of the decay happening in the final days or weeks of the
              option's lifetime.
              <br />
              <br />
              Time decay occurs because as time passes, the chance of the stock making
              a large move decreases. An OTM contract can have plenty of value months
              before expiration, but as the final days approach, it will rapidly
              lose value if it is still out of the money. Simply put, when there
              is less time remaining, there is less of a chance that the stock will
              be able to move in time, making the price that others are willing to
              pay for the option less.
              <br />
              <br />
              Time decay can be "fought" by other factors. The most obvious of course,
              is the price of the underlying stock. If the stock moves upwards enough,
              it can increase the value of the call more than the time decay is taking
              away from the call. Another factor is implied volatility, which can
              offset the decay if it increases enough.
              <br />
              <br />
              Absent of these factors, a call will lose value as expiration approaches.
              The final price of a call will depend on how far ITM it is. All OTM
              calls, which previously were worth something due to the time value,
              will be worthless at expiration.

              Effect of Volatility

              Volatility is a large unknown when trading options. Like the price
              of the stock itself, it is one thing that we cannot easily
              predict. Options will increase in value as implied volatility
              increases, and decrease when IV decreases. In fact, implied
              volatility is actually calculated from the price of the option
              itself compared to the "fair value" price of the option. When
              other traders are willing to pay more for an option, it increases
              that gap, which IV represents.
              <br />
              <br />
              Why would an investor pay more for an option than the theoretical fair
              value? There are many reasons, all of which involve real world events
              that factor into their decision. The most common reason is that an
              earnings announcement is upcoming.
              <br />
              <br />
              Typically, a stock moves either up or down a fair bit when earnings
              are announced, as the company either beats or doesn't meet earning
              expectations. You might think this would be the perfect time to buy
              a call, as there is a chance the stock makes a big move in the coming
              days. Of course, everyone else in the market also thinks this and wants
              to get in on the action. Demand from lots of buyers of an option will
              cause the price of the option to go up. (Just like how lots of demand
              from home buyers or concert-goers allows for sellers to charge more)
              It goes the other way too, as option sellers know their worth and aren't
              going to sell an option that could double in the coming days for cheap.
              <br />
              <br />
              Since there's expectation of a price raise, and therefore higher implied
              volatility, options are going for more than they usually would. However,
              after the announcement, implied volatility (and the price of the option)
              rapidly collapse to typical levels. So even if the price raises a lot
              as a result of the earnings, the call option might be worth less just
              because the IV is now lower (no more expectations that the price could
              raise further).

            <div class="text-white text-lg pl-3 pr-3">
              When dealing with long call options, it's crucial to understand
              their value and how they work. At expiration, the value of a call
              option can be determined using a simple formula, also known as the
              intrinsic value:
              <span class="flex justify-center items-center pt-10">
                <Katex
                  math={"\\text{option price} = \\max(\\text{stock price} - \\text{strike price}, 0)"}
                />
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              This formula reflects that if the stock price exceeds the strike price,
              the option is profitable and worth exercising. For instance, if the
              strike price is $100 and the stock is trading at $105, the option can
              be exercised to buy shares at $100, resulting in a profit of $5 per
              share when sold at the market price.
              <br />
              <br />
              The value of a call option prior to expiry consists of both intrinsic
              value and extrinsic value, commonly referred to as time value. Calculating
              the extrinsic value manually can be complex, often necessitating the
              use of option pricing models.

              <br />
              <br />
              To find the breakeven, simply add the price you paid for the contract(s)
              to the strike price:
              <span class="flex justify-center items-center pt-10">
                <Katex
                  math={"\\text{break-even} = \\text{strike price} + \\text{cost basis}"}
                />
              </span>
